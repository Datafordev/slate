# ![alt tag](images/libraries_icon.png) Client Libraries

Client libraries are the tools that let you develop your own applications to work with Cloudant databases.

Some client libraries are formally [supported](libraries.html#supported-client-libraries) by Cloudant.
These include:

-	[Mobile](libraries.html#mobile)
-	[Java](libraries.html#java)
-	[Node.js](libraries.html#node.js)
-	[Python](libraries.html#python)

A supported library is one where you can contact Cloudant if you encounter a specific, reproducible problem with the library.

Other client libraries have been created by [third parties](libraries.html#third-party-client-libraries).

<aside class="warning">Third party client libraries are not maintained or supported by Cloudant.
If you encounter a specific, reproducible problem with the third party library,
you should contact the library maintainer for assistance.</aside> 

If a library for your preferred language is not available,
why not [let us know?](https://github.com/cloudant-labs/slate/issues)
