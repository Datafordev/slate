## Back up your data

To protect your business from data loss and corruption,
you should backup your data.

Two important principles help you avoid downtime and lost revenue:

-	Backup all your data regularly.
-	Check the integrity of the backups.

Backing up data in Cloudant is performed by using [replication](replication.html) to make a copy of your database.
