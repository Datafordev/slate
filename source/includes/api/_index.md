# API Reference

The Cloudant API reference is intended to be a comprehensive and living catalog of Cloudant's capabilities. Contributions are welcome through [Cloudant Labs on GitHub](https://github.com/cloudant-labs/slate). It's built with [Slate](https://github.com/tripit/slate).

*For the cURL samples* `-u $USERNAME` will prompt you to enter your password before continuing with a given request. You can condense this process by entering `-u $USERNAME:$PASSWORD` within the original command, but note that this stores your password in plain text within the terminal log, so it is not reccomened for security purposes.
