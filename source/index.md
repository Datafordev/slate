# Documentation and Support

## Introduction

Cloudant provides reliable [database](#define_database) hosting and support for applications of any scale. It’s available to users within minutes of [creating an account](https://cloudant.com/sign-up/) because there’s nothing to install. This documentation contains [more detail about Cloudant](#why_cloudant), [the technology which supports it](#concepts), and [API reference](#API) for developers.

Contributions to this documentation can be made through [GitHub](https://github.com/cloudant-labs/slate). Support is available to users through their dashboard and within a dedicated community on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/cloudant).

## Why Cloudant?

Cloudant is the name of both the provider and the service, in this case a database-as-a-service (commonly known as DBaaS). It does not use SQL as it’s query language and it’s distributed over the web, all features which you can read about in more depth here. You can use Cloudant for almost any purpose in any scale of application.
